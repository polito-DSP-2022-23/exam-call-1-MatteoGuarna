## JSON Schemas

This folder contains the JSON Schemas.

The JSON schemas here described represent the object as they conceptually are inside the service. Please take note that the JSON schemas inside the "REST APIs implementation" folder are only used for validation of the input structures, and are obviously very different from those here reported.
